## Project Summary

- Photographer's site that displays and allows contacts from potential customers.

- Problem this site intends to solve:
  - The business has no existing website for contact/scheduling

- MVP: schedule appointment (calendar), see previous work, gallery, contact info (forms)

1. User Story: Contact the photographer

2. As a user, I want to be able to contact the photographer to ask questions or get more information before making an appointment.

3. Feature Tasks
  a. Provide a form with fields for user's contact information (email and/or phone number).
  b. Provide a paragraph-size text box where the user can input what specific information they are seeking, so that when the photographer contacts me back, both are already on the same page.
  c. After completing the form, respond to the user with an estimated time to receive a response.

4. Acceptance Tests
   a. Ensure that the user inputs a valid phone number.
   b. Ensure that the user inputs a valid email address.
   c. Ensure that the user inputs a message for the photographer (no blank text box).
