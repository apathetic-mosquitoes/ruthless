                <p>I am a Russian who was born in Kazakhstan, and moved to the US in 2000. I grew up in Spokane, WA and had, from what I remember, a great childhood filled with lots of work but still had fun. Played (and still play sports) (mainly volleyball nowadays) in high school and college. I went to Eastern Washington University for Computer Science, but quit and moved to King County, WA for stupid reasons. Now I've made my way back into learning how to code again!</p>
