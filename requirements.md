#Software Requirements

**Vision**  
- For the customer to have a nice website to showcase her work, for customers to be able to contact her, and for customers to learn more about her
- Pain point: customer does not have a website for customers to book her, showcase her work, and learn more about her
- Because we will be able to contact one of the best photographers in the area and even hire her for our own photos!

**Scope (In/Out)**  
*In*  
- Learn about the photographer
- Contact the photographer
- Showcase her pictures
- Schedule an appointment
- Cancel an appointment

*Out*  
- Not going to be an actual booking website, because we will be limited to using local storage. This will be a mock website, and if the customer likes it we will probably make her a fully functional and nicer website in 301 or 401
- We will limit the showcase to 50 pictures just to get the understanding of how this site works

**MVP**  
- showcase pictures
- learn about photographer
- contact photographer

**Stretch Goals**  
- Schedule an appointment
- cancel an appointment
- maybe split up the different picture categories like weddings, baby shoots, engagement shoots, family portraits, etc.

**Functionality Requirements**  
1. A user can contact the photographer
2. A user can view the photographers work
3. A user can book an appointment
4. A user can cansel an appointment

**Data Flow**  
A user will come to the site to see a few stunning pictures the photographer took. They will be able to scroll down and read who the photographer is and what they're 
all about. The user will be able to click "Gallery" in the nav bar and be taken to a different page that showcases more of the pictures from the photographer.
At the bottom of the home page will be a form to be able to contact the photographer, and right next to that there will be another form to book a photoshoot. 
The user will get a message that their request has been made and that the photographer will reach out to them shortly, regardless of what form they fill out.
